# pbi_industrial_security_dashboard
This dashboard was designed for monitoring essential industrial security metrics by C-level executives and security officers.

The interface prioritizes clarity and actionable insights: critical alerts are highlighted with color-coded severity levels, trends are visualized through time-series charts, and drill-down capabilities allow users to investigate anomalies at the asset or facility level.

Please note that the visuals are based on **synthetic data** and do not reflect real-world measurements.
